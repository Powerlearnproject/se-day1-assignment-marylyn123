List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- Define the project scope, goals, feasibility, and resource requirements.
2.Requirement analysis- Gather and document software requirements from stakeholders.
3. Design- Define the system architecture, database structure, and overall blueprint of the software.
4. Development (Implementation/Coding)- Convert design specifications into actual software by writing code.
5. Testing-Identify and fix defects to ensure the software meets quality standards.
6. Deployment-Release the software to production or the intended environment.
8. Maintenance & Support-Provide ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- There is Low flexibility,
- changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

When to Use Waterfall:
1.Regulatory or Compliance-Driven Projects
Example: Developing software for healthcare, banking, or aviation where strict documentation and validation are required.
2.Projects with Clear and Fixed Requirements
Example: Building a payroll system where all features are well-defined from the start.

agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
When to Use Agile:
1. Software with Evolving Requirements
Example: A mobile app startup where customer feedback frequently alters features.
2.Fast-Paced and Innovation-Driven Projects
Example: Developing an AI-based chatbot that needs continuous improvement and adaptation.
